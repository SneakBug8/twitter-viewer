Twitter is a popular social media that is often used to spread news contradicting governments' opinions. Since Twitter was banned in Russia, Russian people were denied access to the independent news and opinions published on the platform.

This repo provides a set of scripts that can be deployed on any foreign website host and serve as a Web proxy to share certain threads or tweets to people living in Russia who do not use a VPN.

See in example: http://twitterviewer.rf.gd/tweets.php?url=1508813029441482756
